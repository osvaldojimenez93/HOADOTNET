#### Autumn Mist Closure

Over the last couple of weeks, the city has placed signage across all main roads leading to Autumn Mist to inform people
of the Autumn Mist Closure in and out of Alamo Ranch. The road has been closed as of June 15th and will remain
temporarily closed all summer through September 15th. The HOA and City Council will revisit the consensus for next steps
based on the majority of our residentsâ€™ requests. For questions or concerns, please contact the District 6 office at
210-207-7065 or email them at council.district6@sanantonio.gov. You can also make your voice heard at
[SASpeakUp.com/AutumnMist](https://saspeakup.com/AutumnMist) .

#### 1604 Access Road Slowdown Lane

According to city staff, the construction of the deceleration lane is scheduled to begin in the fall. The HOA board will
be in close communication with the District 6 office and will provide more details as they become available.

#### Homeless Encampments

Please be aware and remain cautious around the Misty Woods and 1604 greenbelt. It has come to our attention that there
is a homeless encampment in the area with approximately 10-20 individuals. The Department of Human Services will be
assessing the location and then schedule an abatement (clean-up) of the property.

#### Commercial Real Estate Notifications

Update regarding the storage site contruction on Misty Woods: Developer for the storage unit complex will have all
required permits finalized in the coming weeks.They are targeting to break ground in September. There are no changes
regarding the site plan and the developer has a full monument signage approval. The HOA board will continue to monitor
the progress and provide updates as they become available.

A few of you may have noticed construction equipment in and around Summer Breeze and Enchanted Sunset. Crews have begun
clearing pathways to take soil samples for an additional storage complex which means we are expected to have a storage
development at both entrances to the neighborhood.

#### City Councilwoman Point of Contact for NSAH Residents

By now, everyone should have received a postcard from the City Council regarding the June 15th closure. They are
interested in hearing your thoughts and collecting additional feedback through the temporary closure.
